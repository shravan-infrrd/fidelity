EAI Estimated Annual Income (EAI) & Estimated Yield (EY) - EAI is an estimate of annual income for a specific security position over the next rolling 12 months. EAI may be negative on short
& EY positions. EY is calculated by dividing the current EAI for a security position by its statement closing date market value. EAI and EY are estimates only and may include return of principal
     and/or capital gains, which would render them overstated. Actual income and yield might be lower or higher than the estimated amounts. For calculation details, refer to the
     "Additional Information and Endnotes" section.

h     The stated Interest Rate is the interest rate effective for Cash Balances in your FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep on the last day of the statement period.

q     Customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at the Program Bank to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance. Subject to the terms of the customer agreement,
      customers are reminded that funds are swept to a Program Bank the business day following the date that funds are credited to your account and until swept to a Program Bank, funds are
      covered by SIPC. For additional information, please see the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep Disclosures on Fidelity.com.
